optional_text: 'It is highly recommended that the video is paused when prompted so
  that students are able to attempt the activities on their own and then check their
  solutions against the video.


  During the video, students will:


  *   Determine the position of a robot gripper from measurements of the robot''s
  components.

  *   Use derivatives to obtain velocity and position from the above information.

  *   Find and apply equations of constraint to solve problems.'

Summary
-------

This video uses robotics as a context for describing rigid body motion and equations of constraint. Illustrative video clips are drawn from the robotics competition in MIT’s 2.007 "Design and Manufacturing" course. The video describes both linear and angular motion.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

After watching this video students will be able to:

*   Explain what is meant by the phrase "rigid body."
*   Describe restrictions on the motion of a object by using equations of constraint.
*   Use derivatives and integrals to connect different measurements of motion.
