  During the video, students will:


  *   Derive the formula for divergence.

  *   Predict whether different example vector fields have positive, negative, or
  zero divergence.'

Summary
-------

This video describes how divergence is a fundamental component of a complex modeling problem involving detonation blasts. The divergence of a vector field is defined physically, and the physical description is connected to the mathematical formula. Students analyze a collection of vector fields to determine whether or not they have positive, negative, or zero divergence by analyzing the change in area or volume of a region of tracer particles.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

After watching this video students will be able to determine points at which a vector field is divergent.
