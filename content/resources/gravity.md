Summary
-------

This video describes gravitational phenomena based on three models of increasing complexity: gravity near Earth’s surface, Newton’s law of gravitation, and General Relativity. Each example is illustrated and connected to the model that best describes it. At the end of the video, students are asked to analyze a set of systems involving gravity. Students see examples and analyze the information needed to describe the system fully.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

After watching this video students will be able to:

*   Recognize the three most common models of gravity and their equations.
*   Analyze situations involving gravity in preparation for problem-solving.
