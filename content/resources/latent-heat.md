optional_text: 'It is highly recommended that the video is paused when prompted so
  that students are able to attempt the activities on their own and then check their
  solutions against the video.


  During the video, students will:


  *   Select a control volume to aid their calculations.

  *   Identify the mass entering, exiting, and accumulating in the control volume.

  *   Calculate unknown quantities using stoichiometry.

  *   Check their solutions against the video.'

Summary
-------

Stephen Ray, a graduate student in the Building Technology Lab at MIT, introduces students to the concept of latent heat. Students gain an understanding of latent heat from the perspective of conservation of energy. Students learn about the use of phase change materials, materials that take advantage of the phenomena of latent heat, to heat and cool buildings.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

After watching this video students will be able to:

*   Describe the energy transformations that occur during a phase change.
*   Apply the law of conservation of energy to phase changes.
