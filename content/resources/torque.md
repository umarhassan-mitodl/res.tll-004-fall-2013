  that students are able to attempt the activities on their own and then check their
  solutions against the video.


  During the video, students will:


  *   Participate in physical activities involving torque and balance

  *   Answer formative assessment questions

  *   Create torque diagrams

  *   Discuss and explain a chair-lifting trick'

Summary
-------

This video uses a series of examples and student-active segments to investigate the concepts of torque and equilibrium. The primary context is balance in the human body. Students are involved in partner activities, brainstorms, and problem-solving segments as the video progresses.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

After watching this video students will be able to:

*   Draw torque diagrams
*   Practice setting up torque problems
*   Determine whether someone can balance
