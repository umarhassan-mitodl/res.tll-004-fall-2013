optional_text: 'It is highly recommended that the video is paused when prompted so
  that students are able to attempt the activities on their own and then check their
  solutions against the video.


  During the video, students will:


  *   Use a Punnett square to predict the outcome of a cross of two mutant flies that
  are heterozygous for a wingless phenotype.

  *   Calculate a Chi square test statistic to analyze the actual outcome of an experiment.

  *   Develop hypotheses that may better explain the experimental observations.

  *   Use the Chi square test for goodness of fit to test their hypotheses.'

Summary
-------

This video introduces students to Chi square hypothesis testing. The Chi square test for goodness of fit is used to analyze experimental data from a basic coin flipping experiment. Students then use what they learned to better understand experimental data obtained from genetic experiments.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

After watching this video students will be able to apply Chi square hypothesis testing to experimental data obtained from genetic experiments.
