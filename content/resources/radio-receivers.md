Summary
-------

This video prompts students to think about how radio receivers select for a particular signal out of all of the radio waves around them. Students see how the components in the regenerative receiver circuit work together to dampen unwanted frequencies, while selectively amplifying and demodulating a desired AM signal.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

After watching this video students will be able to explain how a basic radio receiver circuit functions to select particular radio frequencies.
