optional_text: 'It is highly recommended that the video is paused when prompted so
  that students are able to attempt the activities on their own and then check their
  solutions against the video.


  During the video, students will:


  *   Inspect an expression for variance to convince them that the resultant value
  will always be non-negative.

  *   Compute the variance and sketch it as a function of p for a simple discrete
  distribution.

  *   Compute the first and second moments and the variance for the uniform distribution.'

Summary
-------

This video introduces students to the moments of a distribution and how they can be used to characterize the shape of a distribution. Students apply what they learned to examples of discrete and continuous distributions.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

After watching this video students will be able to:

*   Explain moments of distributions.
*   Compute moments and understand what they mean.
