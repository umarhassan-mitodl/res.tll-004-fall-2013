Summary
-------

This video uses the context of AM radio broadcasting to investigate the many applications of Maxwell’s Equations. Students brainstorm a list about this topic at the beginning, and compare it to the items that are described as the video progresses.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

After watching this video students will be able to:

*   Describe events and devices in terms of Maxwell’s Equations.
*   Decide which equation relates to which phenomena.
