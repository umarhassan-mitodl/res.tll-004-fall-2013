optional_text: 'It is highly recommended that the video is paused when prompted so
  that students are able to attempt the activities on their own and then check their
  solutions against the video.


  During the video, students will:


  *   Find the equation to the tangent line.

  *   Posit why the tangent line is not a good approximation at any intersection point,
  but only tangent intersections.

  *   Compute the error between the exact and approximated solutions to a reaction
  rate problem from chemistry.'

Summary
-------

Prof. Ben Brubaker defines and explores the properties of the linear approximation of a function at a point. The linear approximation is then applied to solve a simple differential equation encountered in chemical kinetics.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

After watching this video students will be able to:

*   Recognize the linear approximation of a function as the tangent line to the function.
*   Apply linear approximations to solve a simple differential equation.
*   Explain the limitations of linear approximations mathematically and graphically.
