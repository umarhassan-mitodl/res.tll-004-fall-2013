optional_text: 'It is highly recommended that the video is paused when prompted so
  that students are able to attempt the activities on their own and then check their
  solutions against the video.


  During the video, students will:


  *   Think of everyday objects that are chiral.

  *   Identify objects that are not chiral and try to determine what property of the
  object makes it achiral.

  *   Determine whether a molecule is chiral based on rules presented in the video.

  *   Examine the chirality of the primary and secondary structure of the Anti-freeze
  protein, the symmetry of its binding partner, water, and how these two molecules
  bind.'

Summary
-------

In this video, students are introduced to the concept of chiral molecules and the relationship between molecular structure and function. Students first analyze some everyday objects and determine if they are chiral or achiral. Students then extend this idea to small molecules and proteins. Mirror image proteins are discussed, specifically antifreeze proteins.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

After watching this video students will be able to:

*   Identify chiral objects and molecules.
*   Understand how chirality plays a role in the function of biological compounds.
