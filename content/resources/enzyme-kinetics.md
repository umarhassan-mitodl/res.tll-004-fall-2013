optional_text: 'It is highly recommended that the video is paused when prompted so
  that students are able to attempt the activities on their own and then check their
  solutions against the video.


  During the video, students will:


  *   Derive a rate law for an enzyme-catalyzed reaction.

  *   Consider the mathematics behind the steady-state approximation.

  *   Think about how a proposed rate law might reveal useful information about a
  reaction mechanism.'

Summary
-------

Prof. Krystyn Van Vliet discusses the importance and utility of enzyme kinetics for drug development. Alongside the video, students derive a rate equation (the Michaelis-Menten equation) for a simple enzyme-substrate system. Returning to the drug development example, students see that rate equations can help them infer information about reaction mechanisms.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

After watching this video students will be able to:

*   Explain how enzymes affect reaction rates.
*   Derive a rate law for a general enzyme-catalyzed reaction.
