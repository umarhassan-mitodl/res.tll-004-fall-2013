optional_text: 'It is highly recommended that the video is paused when prompted so
  that students are able to attempt the activities on their own and then check their
  solutions against the video.


  During the video, students will:


  *   Select a control volume to aid their calculations.

  *   Identify the mass entering, exiting, and accumulating in the control volume.

  *   Calculate unknown quantities using stoichiometry.

  *   Check their solutions against the video.'

Summary
-------

This video reviews the law of conservation of mass and basic stoichiometry. Students are introduced to control volumes as a conceptual tool to aid in problem solving. Students use the concepts of mass conservation and control volumes to find unknown information in examples about a growing plant (photosynthesis) and a rusting car (iron oxidation).

Learning Objectives
-------------------

After watching this video, students will be able to apply the law of conservation of mass to real-world scenarios.
