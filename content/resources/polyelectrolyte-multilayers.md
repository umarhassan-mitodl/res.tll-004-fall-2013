  that students are able to attempt the activities on their own and then check their
  solutions against the video.


  During the video, students will determine if acidic or basic species on given polymers
  will be positively and negatively charged at a given pH.'

Summary
-------

In this video, students learn about layer-by-layer assembly of polyelectrolyte multilayer films. They see how the chemical structure of the macromolecules used in the films affects the function and properties of the film. Students learn how these films have been used to regenerate bone tissue components in rats.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

After watching this video students will be able to explain how the concepts of pH and pKa are useful in the design of materials via layer-by-layer assembly.
