  During the video, students will brainstorm chemical and physical processes that

Summary
-------

This video combines the concepts of modeling, conservation of mass, and differential equations to estimate the concentration of estrogen in Massachusetts Bay. Students consider what the dominant inputs and outputs may be and see how simplifying assumptions make the differential equation easier to solve.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

After watching this video students will be able to:

*   Construct a differential equation to estimate the concentration of a chemical in the environment.
*   Appreciate how informed estimates can help simplify and solve these differential equations.
