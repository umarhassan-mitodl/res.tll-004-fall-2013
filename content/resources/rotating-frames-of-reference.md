optional_text: 'It is highly recommended that the video is paused when prompted so
  that students are able to attempt the activities on their own and then check their
  solutions against the video.


  During the video, students will:


  *   Determine whether or not a force opposite an applied tension force on a disk
  on a rotating turntable exists, and where it comes from.

  *   Determine the velocity of the disk in the ground frame, given that it is not
  moving in the turntable frame.

  *   Compute a general formula that finds the acceleration of an object in one frame
  in terms of the acceleration in another, given that one frame is rotating but not
  translating with respect to the other.

  *   Apply the formula to determine the accelerations of objects in two different
  examples.

  *   Discuss why the observed motion of a rolled ball is curved in a rotating frame
  of reference.

  *   Predict the motion of a rolled ball as observed from the ground frame.

  *   Use the Coriolis effect to explain why hurricanes in the Northern hemisphere
  rotate counterclockwise.'

Summary
-------

This video leads students through descriptions of the motion of two objects observed from two frames of reference: a rotating turntable, and the relatively stationary ground frame. The centripetal and Coriolis accelerations that arise in rotating frames of reference are explored. Finally, we use the Coriolis effect to explain the rotational direction of hurricanes in the Northern Hemisphere.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

After watching this video students will be able to:

*   Explain why centripetal and Coriolis accelerations arise in rotating frames of reference.
*   Apply their understanding of the Coriolis acceleration to determine the direction of rotation of hurricanes.
