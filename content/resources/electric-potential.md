  that students are able to attempt the activities on their own and then check their
  solutions against the video.


  During the video, students will:


  *   Recall different aspects of the electric field and electric potential.

  *   Discuss electrical breakdown in terms of both the electric field and the electric
  potential.

  *   Draw electric field vectors and equipotential lines in a way that uses and reinforces
  the relationship between them.'

Summary


-----------

This video begins with a review of electric field and electric potential, focusing on their similarities and differences and the way they are most commonly represented. A video clip from the Boston Museum of Science's Theatre of Electricity helps to transition into a discussion of electrical breakdown, which is described in detail. Students are asked to consider the role of the field and/or the potential in creating a spark during electrical breakdown.

Learning Objectives

After watching this video students will:

*   Have a clearer picture of the electric field and electric potential.
    
*   Be able to describe electrical breakdown in terms of the electric field or electric potential.
